# Dataset-7-forced-vibration-and-shock
A dataset that looks at PCBs under continuous vibration before undergoing shock test

This dataset contains the measured acceleration data for an electronics unit under continuous vibration before undergoing a shock test. Figure 1 presents the experimental test configuration where the package is mounted on a Lansmont Model P30 shock test system designed to generate a continuous forced vibration before, after, and during a shock event <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaZF9kUQLQ&ab_channel=ARTS-LabattheUniversityofSouthCarolina">here</a>.
